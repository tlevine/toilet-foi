Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, please provide me an electronic copy
of any documents giving evidence of the dates and times at which toilets for all
GSA buildings were cleaned.

At a minimum, please indicate

* the dates and times of each of the cleanings,
* the buildings in which the the toilets are located
* the locations of the toilets within the buildings, such as the room numbers or the floor of the building,
* and the gender of the bathroom

for every building managed by the General Services Administration from January 1,
2012 until the date it takes you to complete this request, now or sometime after
February 13, 2013. Where available, please provide the data electronically.

I respectfully request a fee waiver under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) for the following reasons.

* I plan to use the documents for two studies to the public's benefit.
  1. A study on human behavior involved the use and cleaning of bathrooms
  2. A comparison of the actual cleaning practices to various sanitation standards

* I have experience with behavioral and environmental health research. I thus am
    able to digest the documents and disseminate my findings.
  * Here is a recent human behavioral study of mine on the use of toilets.
      http://thomaslevine.com/!/hovering-cycle
  * I work frequently with data journalists. Here is some evidence of this.
      XXX

* I plan to make the documents available to the public on my website,
    so many people will have access to the documents, particularly other
    bathroom behavior researchers

If a fee waiver is denied, please let me know in advance if the cost will be more than $25

(GSA runs all the buildings)
